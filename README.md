## Presentation
DashEngine is an Unreal Engine 4 Sonic Framework/Devkit which provides all the tools, gimmicks, and gameplay needed to start building awesome (or not...) 3D Sonic fangames.
It is shipped with an **Adventure Sonic** gameplay style and a **Modern Sonic** gameplay style. *And with some tweaks you can even create a* ***Classic Sonic*** *gameplay style in a 2.5D world !*

Everything can be customized in DashEngine... From the model of your character to the amount of momentum sonic will earn.

This repository currently hosts Version **1.1.0** of DashEngine and it is maintained by Marvin, Dynu, Novarek and all the others contributors from the community.
